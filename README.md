Analysis of Tracking Systems

Course Description:

This course covers topics related to tracking systems, focusing on the filtering methods used to mitigate noise. It is assumed the student has a strong mathematical background and is proficient in MATLAB, C and/or Python programming.
Topics include model fitting and the normal equations, nonlinear soultions, Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, particle filter, unscented transform, recursive Bayesian estimation, and hidden Markov models. In labwork, several of these ideas are implemented by the student.
